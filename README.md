# How to use
Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create an account and project. Add the YouTube Data API v3. And then create api key and an OAuth 2.0 client ID. Place you client secret file in the same folder as the python file and rename it it "client_secret.json". Then in the python file change the api key to your api key. From there you should be fine. 
# What I learnt
This was my first project working with an api and I learnt a lot. From how to get the api key to making requests. I learnt how to quickly navigate the documentation to solve my problem effiently. I learned how to use many libaries, for example apiclient, urllib, datetime, webbrowser and oauth2client.
